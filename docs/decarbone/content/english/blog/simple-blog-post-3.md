Car conversions are still new for European countries compared to the United States where it is widespread since 10 years. Since the technologies become more and more mature, conversions have been put in a new gear for its development.

However, the regulations are slow to arrive. While it is easier to convert a car in the United Kingdom, in Netherlands, or in eastern countries, France and Belgium are bad students: there is still no legal framework for the conversion, it is assimilated as a classic tuning of the vehicle.

Currently, to customize a car, you need the approval of the car manufacturer and make several certification tests for each car converted. In 2020, this will change in France. They adopted a new policy to facilitate the greenification of car fleets. Two main barriers will fall down. First, the approval from the manufacturer won’t be necessary anymore.
Secondly, once a model has been tested by the competent authorities for certification, the next conversion on the same models do not need to be certified again.

This is a strong step forward in France for the conversion and the text has been passed to the European Commission. It is just a matter of time for Belgium to follow the other countries.

Meanwhile, the conversion is legally difficult but still possible. That’s why Decarbone involves itself to speed up the regularization of vehicle conversions!
