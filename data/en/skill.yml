  title : Green transition
  subtitle : Circular Economy
  content : Converting the car does not only bring a better experience of riding, it also saves obsolete cars from the trash. One car converted is one car less produced, saving a lot of grey energy and GHG emissions necessary for  manufacture. This is pure circular economy.

  subtitlebis : Eco-friendly
  contentbis : Riding electric eliminates all emissions from the exhaust pipe. No more local CO2, no more fine particles. In Belgium when electric vehicles are on the road they produce 5 times less CO2 than thermal cars and this will get improved further with the penetration of low carbon electricity production. Converting your car to electricity is the way to be more environment friendly.
